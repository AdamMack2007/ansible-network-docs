<br>

My name is Adam Mack and I am a Ansible Solutions Architect at Red Hat and previously a network engineer for about 11 years.
<br>

You could have probably guessed by all of my mountain pictures that I am into the outdoors. When I am not working I am travelling somewhere or in the mountains either skiing, mountain biking, fly fishing, hiking or backpacking.
<br>

If you are ever in Utah and want to get out and explore hit me up on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-mack07/)
